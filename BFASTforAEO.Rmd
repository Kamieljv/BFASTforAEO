This document explains how to use R scripting language for downloading MODIS data and analysing it within R. The results of the analysis of MODIS data within R are illustrated. For this time series analysis demonstration it is not required to know R details, we only use R for some practical demonstration of its great potential.
In this exercise we will automatically download MODIS data for specific locations, i.e. Flux tower sites, around the world. 
First, an introduction to MODIS satellite data and the flux tower sites is presented. Second, the use of R is introduced. Finally, the exercise in R is explained, step by step. 

# MODIS satellite data

The MODIS satellite data that we will download for this time series analysis exercise is available from [the following site](http://daac.ornl.gov/cgi-bin/MODIS/GR_col5_1/mod_viz.html). MODIS data is made available for subsets above a global network of flux towers. FLUXNET, a "network of regional networks", coordinates regional and global analysis of observations from micrometeorological tower sites. The flux tower sites use eddy covariance methods to measure the exchanges of carbon dioxide (*CO2*), water vapor, and energy between terrestrial ecosystems and the atmosphere.  The FLUXNET database contains information about tower location and site characteristics as well as data availability.

For this exercise  we will focus on the analysis of MODIS satellite data available for these flux towers. More specifically, we will look at the MODIS product called MOD13Q1 which are global 16-day images at a spatial resolution of 250 m. Each image contains several bands; i.e. blue, red, and near-infrared reflectances, centered at 469-nanometers, 645-nanometers, and 858-nanometers, respectively, are used to determine the MODIS vegetation indices.
The MODIS Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) complements NOAA's Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) NDVI products and provides continuity for time series historical applications. MODIS also includes a new Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) that minimises canopy background variations and maintains sensitivity over dense vegetation conditions. The EVI also uses the blue band to remove residual atmosphere contamination caused by smoke and sub-pixel thin cloud clouds. The MODIS NDVI and EVI products are computed from atmospherically corrected bi-directional surface reflectances that have been masked for water, clouds, heavy aerosols, and cloud shadows.
Vegetation indices are used for global monitoring of vegetation conditions and are used in products displaying land cover and land cover changes. These data may be used as input for modeling global biogeochemical and hydrologic processes and global and regional climate. These data also may be used for characterizing land surface biophysical properties and processes, including primary production and land cover conversion.
We will work with the MODIS NDVI band within the MOD13Q1 product. More information about this MODIS product can be found via the [MODIS product table](https://lpdaac.usgs.gov/dataset_discovery/modis/modis_products_table/mod13q1_v006).


> Question 1: By what factor does the 250m MODIS NDVI image layer need to 
be multiplied in order to obtain values between 0 and 1?

> Question 2: What rank key (number?) would you use to obtain Good Data?


# Online Analysis of MODIS satellite image data

Please go to the [MODIS Land subsets website](http://daac.ornl.gov/cgi-bin/MODIS/GR_col5_1/mod_viz.html):

  * Select Country: The Netherlands and select the Loobos Site. 
  * Have a look at the Corner coordinates and site details (this will be important for the R script as explained below).
  * Via this site the data can be downloaded manually. We will automatically download the MODIS data via the R script.
  * Click on Time Series Advanced Version (User Defined QC setting) and select the MOD13Q1 data.
  * Look at the NDVI time series data and also click on the google maps link to investigate the land cover type. It is mainly forested by Pinus Sylvestris or also called Scots Pine (within google maps satellite view).

> Question 3: At which pixel number is the flux tower (i.e. the Site pixel) positioned in the MODIS 250m data grid (have a look at the link for corner coordinates and site details)

> Question 4: What happens with the NDVI Filter Applied Graph if you select only data that you can use with Confidence?

# Getting started with R

We will download the MODIS data for the Loobos Site via R and process the data for one location to detect changes within the time series.

Now if need you can follow the following tutorial on getting started with [R and Rstudio](https://geoscripting-wur.github.io/Scripting4GeoIntro/#Basic_R_and_RStudio_setup).


# Install packages and define functions for MODIS data analysis

Now we are ready to get started with the MODIS time series analysis exercise in R! 
First, choose your working directory (i.e. a folder on your hard drive) to which the MODIS data will be downloaded and where you will save your R script. Set your workdirectory in R using the `setwd()` command. Remark: on your computer the file path looks different on windows! In R you have to change the backslash symbol to a forward slash symbol e.g.: 
  
```{r, eval = FALSE}
## "c:\student\MODIS"
setwd(c("c:/student/MODIS/"))
getwd() ## to check what your working directory is.
```

Second, make sure your package installed in R are up-to-date by:

```{r, eval=FALSE, echo=TRUE}
update.packages(ask=FALSE)

## we install the latest bfast package from the R-forge website
install.packages("bfast", repos="http://R-Forge.R-project.org", dependencies=TRUE)

## for mac users you can do
install.packages("bfast", repos="http://R-Forge.R-project.org", 
                 dependencies=TRUE, type = "source")

```

The necessary add-on packages need to be installed within R before loading the using the `library()` function. Below we define a helper function that does installing and loading of the packages for us. 

```{r, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, eval=TRUE}
# pkgTest is a helper function to load packages and install packages only when they are not installed yet.
pkgTest <- function(x)
{
  if (x %in% rownames(installed.packages()) == FALSE) {
    install.packages(x, dependencies= TRUE)    
  }
  library(x, character.only = TRUE)
}
neededPackages <- c("strucchange","forecast","zoo", "bfast")
for (package in neededPackages){pkgTest(package)}
```


The two functions defined in the section below need to be run at once (select all of them in the R script window and do *Crtl-r*). 
This will define two functions which we will need to process the MODIS data time series. 
So nothing will happen now in R, but the function are loaded and ready to be used in the script sections below. 

> Note: you do not need to understand the details of the two functions below. 
Make sure you know how to use them. Understanding the details of the two functions below is only for advanced R users (so optional and not required for AEO!).

```{r}
## a function to create a regular "ts" (time series) object in R using time information (dt)
timeser <- function(index,dt) {
	z <- zoo(index,dt)
	yr <- as.numeric(format(time(z), "%Y"))
	jul <- as.numeric(format(time(z), "%j"))
	delta <- min(unlist(tapply(jul, yr, diff))) # 16
	zz <- aggregate(z, yr + (jul - 1) / delta / 23)
	(tso <- as.ts(zz))
	return(tso)	
}

## a function to remove values (set NA)
## that do not equal a certain criteria
sel <- function(y,crit){
	ts.sel <- y
	ts.sel[!crit] <- NA
	return(ts.sel)
}
```

# Downloading MODIS data using R script

Now we are ready to start downloading the MODIS data. 
There are two methods:
  * automatic downloading via the ftp server in the U.S. within R using the code section below
  * manual downloading of the data. 

We recommend using the automatic downloading method for the exercise. 

## Automatic MODIS data downloading 

We will use this method in the exercise as long as the server in the U.S. is online and working (you need internet connection, and also keep in mind that the file can be more than 15Mb large).

```{r, eval = FALSE}
getwd() ## the file is downloaded to your working directory 
```


```{r}
fluxtower <- c("fn_nlloobos.txt")  
filename <- paste(
"ftp://daac.ornl.gov//data/modis_ascii_subsets//C5_MOD13Q1/data/MOD13Q1."
, fluxtower,sep="")

## now download the file only if the .csv file does not exist yet on your computer
## then read the csv file using the 'read.csv' function

 if(!file.exists(fluxtower)) {
  download.file(filename,fluxtower)
	modis <- read.csv(fluxtower, colClasses = "character") 
} else {
	modis <- read.csv(fluxtower, colClasses = "character") 
}
## if the above step does not work you can download the data manually 
## (go to 'Manual Downloading').
```


By running the lines above the MODIS data subset for the Loobos fluxtower (the Netherlands) is downloaded to the`modis` variable. 
Please be patient when running the code section above. 

Data for a different fluxtower, a fluxtower in New South Wales, Australia, can be downloaded by changing the `fluxtower` variable using the following line:

```{r}
fluxtower <- c("fn_autumbar.txt")
```

Now try and change the name of the flux tower site and then rerun the section above to download data for another flux tower. 

The names of the flux towers for which MODIS data is available can be found in the following file available via this link: [MODISSubsetSiteInformation](ftp://daac.ornl.gov//data/modis_ascii_subsets//5_MODIS_Subset_Sites_Information_Collection5.csv)
, which you can open in Excel. The names that you need are in the `Site_ID` column.

## Manual MODIS data Downloading

If the above section does not work, you can download the data manually into your working directory via the following site:
[ModisViZ](http://daac.ornl.gov/cgi-bin/MODIS/GR_col5_1/mod_viz.html) and can be loaded in R via the R script below. 
Things to do to download the data manually:

  - download the .txt file from the MODIS Land Subsets website mentioned above, go to the e.g. Loobos site, click download the ASCII file, do *save as*, **txt** file to save to a local folder, 
  and rename the file to e.g. NDVIMOD13Q1.

  - Read the data from R with the following R script lines.

You can read in the data file using the following command. Now the MODIS data is loaded!

```{r, eval=FALSE}
modis <- read.csv("NDVIMOD13Q1.txt")
```

## The MODIS CSV file data structure

The MODIS data within the 'modis'  variable is organised so that the first six columns of the file contain information
about filename, product (i.e. MOD13Q1), date (date of the image), Site (e.g. Loobos), Processdata, and band
(i.e. one MODIS image has different bands = LAYERS, e.g. NDVI). For More information about the MODIS data look at, the [MODIS product table](https://lpdaac.usgs.gov/products/modis_products_table).

```{r}
str(modis[1,1:7])
```

The following R names() shows the names of the first 8 columns of the 'modis' variable containing all the data.

```{r}
names(modis)[1:8]
```

The first six columns contain info about the image (e.g. site, date, band, and when it is processed) and from the 7th each column contains information
about each MODIS pixel within the subset. E.g the 7th column is a pixel, and the 8th is another pixel. This shows the band names of this file. The MOD13Q1 Product contains 12 Bands:

```{r}
modis$Band[1:12]
```

# Visualising modis time series above the fluxtower

## Plotting a MODIS NDVI time series

We select band 5 i.e. the NDVI band, and band 7 i.e. the band with reliability information

```{r}
ndvibandname <- modis$Band[5] 
rel <- modis$Band[7] 
```

We will select data for the pixel above the Loobos Fluxtower. Have a look at 
[LoobosSiteInfo](http://daac.ornl.gov/cgi-bin/MODIS/GR_col5_1/corners.1.pl?site=fn_nlloobos&res=250m).

It is pixel number 436. Each column after the 6th column in the MODIS file contains data of one pixel 
so to select the data above the flux tower we have to add 6 to select the correct column within the matrix.
The code section below will select the MODIS data for one pixel, scale the NDVI data by dividing it by 10000,
and then plot the resulting variable `ts.NDVI` using the `plot()` function:

```{r}
j <- (436)+6 # we are adding 6 since the first data column is the 7th column  
reliability <- as.numeric(modis[modis$Band == rel, j]) # reliability data
NDVI <- as.numeric(modis[modis$Band == ndvibandname, j]) # NDVI data
DATUM <- modis[modis$Band == ndvibandname, 3] # dates
DATUM <- as.Date(DATUM,"A%Y%j") # convert to a datum type
```

Now, let's create a time series! The NDVI value need to be scaled between 0-1 by dividing them by 10000.
Attention! The `Zoo` package is needed within the `timeser` function so we load the package using the line below.


```{r, message=FALSE}
library(zoo) ## load the package
ts.rel <- timeser(reliability, DATUM)
ts.NDVI <- timeser(NDVI/10000, DATUM)
```

Now plot the resulting `ts.NDVI` object:

```{r, fig.width=20, fig.height=10}
plot(ts.NDVI, ylab = "NDVI") 
```

> Question 5: Below a code section is provided that you can use (copy/paste and customize). 
Select multiple pixels (e.g. 6 pixels) and derive an average, maximum, and median of the selected time series. 
Now make a plot showing the average, maximum, or median of the 3 NDVI time series. 
Compare the median NDVI time series with the NDVI time series of the flux tower and copy paste the R plot output in your report. 
Which approach do you think would be suitable to reduce the noise within a time series? Explain why?
**For bonus points and an extra challenge**:
Try to derive a 'noise reduced' NDVI time series of a 3 by 3 window around the flux tower.


```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, fig.width=11, fig.height=6}
## this is an example for two pixels
## try it out and customize for your own needs
j <- 442:444  
t <- modis[modis$Band == ndvibandname, j] # extract NDVI data
tt <- data.matrix(t)/10000 ## convert to a data matrix and divide by 10000
ttt <- ts(apply(tt, 2, timeser, DATUM), start=c(2000,4), freq=23) 
## convert to a regular time series object
## plot(ttt) ## plot all the time series
## derive the statistics (max, mean):
maxt <- ts(apply(ttt, 1, max, na.rm=TRUE), start=c(2000,4), freq=23)
meant <- ts(apply(ttt, 1, mean, na.rm=TRUE), start=c(2000,4), freq=23)
## plot
plot(maxt, col="green", ylim=c(0,1))
lines(meant, col="red")
```


## Use the MODIS Reliability information to clean the NDVI time series

Now, we will visualize MODIS reliability information using the `sel` function defined above. 

The code section below plot a red point on the plot for all the data points in the time series with a reliability > 1. 
You can choose `ts.rel = 1`, or `ts.rel > 2`, or ..., and rerun the plot command again and see what happens.

```{r, warning=FALSE, fig.width=11, fig.height=6}
plot(ts.NDVI)
lines(sel(ts.NDVI,ts.rel > 1), col = "red", type = "p") 
legend("bottomleft","pixels with a low reliablity",col=2,pch=1)
```


> Question 6: Investigation of MODIS reliability scores. What happens if you select only good quality NDVI data? Can you explain what happens and why this could be? Discuss.

Perform the cleaning and plot the result by running the following lines. The resulting plot will show the MODIS NDVI time series showing red section which indicate the zones that are deleted based on reliability information.

```{r}
ts.clNDVI <- ts.NDVI
ts.clNDVI[ts.rel > 1] <- NA  # delete data with reliability > 1
```

 
 By applying the two R script lines above, we set all the points with a reliability above 1 to NA (i.e. Not Available which is similar as deleting the value) in the *ts.clNDVI* variable. 
 Now, plot the result of the cleaning and compare with the non-cleaned time series:

```{r, fig.width=11, fig.height=6}
plot(ts.NDVI, col='red')
lines(ts.clNDVI, lwd=2, col='black')  
```

There are still clouds effects visible in the NDVI time series after using the MODIS reliability information. 
The reliability information available with each MODIS image indicates how reliable the data is and is based on the cloud masking results, atmospheric data (aerosol thickness), 
satellite viewing angle, etc. More information about the reliability is available via the [MODIS Product Table website](https://lpdaac.usgs.gov/dataset_discovery/modis/modis_products_table/mod13q1_v006).

# Applying BFAST on cleaned NDVI time series

In this section we will use BFAST on the cleaned NDVI time series to detect changes within the time series. First, we will interpolate the gaps in the cleaned NDVI time series using a simple linear interpolation approach. The function that we use for this is the \textbf{na.aprox()} function which looks for NA's (Not Available's), which means dates for which no data is available (e.g., that we removed in the previous steps) and interpolates the data. 
The 'plot()' command of the results 'ts.clNDVIfilled}' visualizes the result of the interpolation.

```{r, fig.width=20, fig.height=10}
ts.clNDVIfilled <- na.approx(ts.clNDVI)
plot(ts.clNDVIfilled, ylim=c(0.1, 1))
```

Second, we apply the BFAST function onto the time series. We determine this minimum distance between potentially detected breaks. 
Here, we set the distance to 25 time steps (i.e. 25 16-day images). Then we apply the BFAST function (bfast()) on the time series..

```{r, eval=FALSE}
rdist <- 25/length(ts.clNDVIfilled)
## ratio of distance between breaks (time steps) and length of the time series
fit <- bfast(ts.clNDVIfilled, h=rdist,
             season="harmonic", max.iter=1)
plot(fit, main="")
```

> Question 7: copy  and paste the resulting R BFAST graph in the report and describe the detected components and change types, detected within the time series. Are there any detected breaks? How strict would you do the cleaning?

> Question 8: Download data from another location on earth and run all the steps mentioned above again in order to apply the BFAST function again onto a new cleaned NDVI time series. Copy the BFAST plot to your report, mention the flux tower that you downloaded the data from and describe the difference with the graph obtained from Question 7.}
